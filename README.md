# Golang bootstrap project


## Purpose:
Getting your go environment set up for the first time is a bit of a pain and ideally we'd like to use container based development.  So this repo is intended:
* Provide a functional go setup.
* Install a basic development environment (VIM) 
* Install the basic go packages (dep, go tools etc).
* Be usable right out of the box.

## Future steps:
* Add a template command that takes this repo and installs it into a named repo under your go path.
* Template out the docker-compose steps so that the directories are named properly.
